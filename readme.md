# Analyst1 Technical Evaluation

## Overview

This challenge provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate your technical skills and showcase your knowledge of Angular framework, JavaScript and CSS.

## Evaluation Procedure

The project is a simple "TODO" application where users input items on the left column and hit 'Enter' or the 'Save' button to display them below. Fork this StackBlitz, and implement the requirements mentioned below. Finally, share the editor URL.

## Evaluation Requirements

Your task is to modify the application to enable a user to remove an item from the display list by clicking on it. This action should remove the item from the repository service and update the view accordingly.

## Going Beyond

The evaluation is designed to be straightforward and won't require a significant amount of time. There are no hidden obstacles or tricks to catch you off guard. Our intention is to use the evaluation as a foundation for further discussion in the next stage of the interview process. We strongly encourage you to take the opportunity to showcase your skills, experience, and interests by going above and beyond the minimum requirements. Don't hesitate to include any additional features or functionalities that you believe would best demonstrate your capabilities.
